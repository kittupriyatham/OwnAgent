# OwnAgent

A basic agentic ai with gemini-2.0-flash as base and has tools such as file read, write and append, search and terminal commands run access. 
I used langchain framework and tavily for search. I also, maintain both process log and chat history log, both with timestamps.
setup your environment variables GOOGLE_API_KEY, TAVILY_API_KEY in your system/user/project. (In project, you can use .env file).
